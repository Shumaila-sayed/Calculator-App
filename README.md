# üßÆ Calculator Project
A sleek and fully functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a great opportunity to explore problem-solving, state management, and user experience design.

## üìå Features
 - **Basic Math Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 - **Chained Calculations**: Perform operations like 12 + 7 - 5 seamlessly.
 - **Error Handling**:
    - Displays a snarky error message for attempts to divide by 0.
    - Handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., consecutive operators).
 - **Decimal Support**: Input floating-point numbers and ensure no duplicate decimals.
 - **Backspace Button**: Undo the last input.
 - **Clear Button**: Reset the calculator for fresh calculations.
 - **Keyboard Support**: Perform calculations faster using your keyboard.
 - **Responsive Design**: The calculator looks great on various devices.

## üéØ What I Learned
This project helped sharpen both my technical and problem-solving skills. Key takeaways include:

1. **Logic Building**: Implementing chained operations and managing calculator state taught me how to structure complex logic efficiently.
2. **Error Handling**: Addressing edge cases (like dividing by zero, duplicate decimals, or invalid operator sequences) reinforced the importance of robustness in software.
3. **User Experience**: Adding intuitive features like keyboard support, backspace, and clear improved usability significantly.
4. **Modular Code**: Writing clean and reusable functions (add(), subtract(), operate()) made the project easier to build and debug.
Iterative Development: Building the project step-by-step, starting with basic functionality, kept the process organized and manageable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
 - HTML: For the structure.
 - CSS: For the styling.
 - JavaScript: For the interactivity and functionality.
